### How to build  
To build the project, just clone the repo, and type `make all`. It'll create a
two binary files - `server` and `client`.  

### How to start the project  
After project built, in the first terminal start the server: `./server` (by
default it'll listen 65123 port), and to simulate the work of the client you
need to execute `./client` in a new terminal.
